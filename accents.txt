Plain TeX makes it possible to typeset the most commonly used accents:

\^ (circumflex or “hat”): â

\" (umlaut or dieresis): ä

\~ (tilde or “squiggle”): ã

\= (macron or “bar”): ā

\. (dot accent): ȧ

\u (breve accent): ă

\v (háček or “check”): ǎ

\H (long Hungarian umlaut): ő

\t (tie-after accent): a͡

\c (cedilla): ş

\d (dot-under accent): ạ

\b (bar-under accent): ο̩

\k (ogonek): ą

The Unicode character encoding UTF8 includes several special characters and characters with accents. The following code specifies that the encoding of the LaTeX document source file is UTF8. As font encoding is specified T1, because it supports the encoding of extended character sets in fonts:

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
Of course, the encoding in the text editor needs to be set to utf8, as well.
